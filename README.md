## Description
The backend database has been created to support e-commerce websites using Express.js API and Sequelize to connect to the MySQL database. The backend database allows the user to create a development database, seed it with test data and sync several Sequelize models to the MySQL database. The user has the ability to use GET, POST, DELETE and PUT routes to display and update data in their database.
